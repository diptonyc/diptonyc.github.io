          <strong><em>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis</em></strong
          >,or northern lights, begin high in the Earth’s atmosphere when
          charged particles from the sun collide with atoms and molecules in the
          Earth’s magnetosphere. These energetic interactions typically occur
          near the magnetic poles, where the Earth's magnetic field is
          strongest. The result? A colorful, dancing light show that can paint
          the sky with glowing hues of green, pink, red, purple, and blue,
          depending on the type of gas involved and the altitude of the
          collisions. Want a fun fact? The most common color, green, comes from
          oxygen molecules about 60 miles above the Earth. Red auroras come from
          higher-altitude oxygen, and purples or blues are due to nitrogen.

        The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near
        Antarctica...

        In polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night... try using a
        sky guide app.
